This script scrapes the Stuff website to find the Riddle URLs for today's and yesterday's morning and afternoon quizzes. It creates an HTML file that I host on [dothequiz.com](https://www.dothequiz.com). The script is scheduled to run a couple of minutes are Stuff quizzes are posted (5am for morning quiz, 3pm for afternoon).
